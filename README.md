# Arabic Music Research homepage

### Built on React.js using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB

Development page is live at [https://whispering-sands-88923.herokuapp.com](https://whispering-sands-88923.herokuapp.com).

Next Up
* EventForm and AddCollection currently redirect, it would be better if they just forced render (probably a state/props issue)
* Delete Item is not working (Delete Comment is)
* Something is odd with the http vs https of the icon fonts, should be http
* Cancel buttons for edits render new state (they don't wait for new props). Could pull form info from state and displayed info from props...
* Put the add event/collection button somewhere better
* CFP/Notices section on resources page
* Change Arabic to Arab throughout


Eventually:
* Review what pages we need, edit navigation bar in HTML files
* SAMR page with link to email list
* Pagination for lists
* Filter by tags
* Login functionality
* Only admins can delete resource collections
* Member info pages that collect authored materials
* Blog on Medium
* Concat and uglify CSS and JS libraries
* Make images responsive
* Civility and IP disclaimer
