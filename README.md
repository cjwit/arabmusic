Next Up
* Edit functionality for comments, items (in editcomment branch, add edit buttons back in)
* Link for individual items: if any, connect to item title
* Editing triggers a flag (Edited [by author] on [date])
* EventForm and AddCollection currently redirect, it would be better if they just forced render (probably a state/props issue)
